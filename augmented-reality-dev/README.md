We will be adding more resources and sample projects in the future. Stay tunned !


## Popular Frameworks

* [Vuforia](https://library.vuforia.com/)
Vuforia Engine is one of the most widely used platform for AR development, with support for the majority of phones, tablets, and eyewear. Developers can easily add advanced computer vision functionality to Android, iOS, and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps, to create AR experiences that realistically interact with objects and the environment.

* [Unity AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@4.2/manual/index.html)
 allows you to work with augmented reality platforms in a multi-platform way within Unity. This package presents an interface for Unity developers to use, but doesn't implement any AR features itself. To use AR Foundation on a target device, you also need separate packages for the target platforms officially supported by Unity such as ARCore, ARKit, Magic Leap, or Windows XR Plug-ins.

* [Google ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar)
 is Googleâ€™s platform for building augmented reality experiences. Using different APIs, ARCore enables your phone to sense its environment, understand the world and interact with information. Some of the APIs are available across Android and iOS to enable shared AR experiences.

* [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit)
 is an iOS framework that combines device motion tracking, camera scene capture, advanced scene processing, and display conveniences to simplify the task of building an AR experience.

* [AR.js](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/)
is a lightweight library for Augmented Reality on the Web, coming with features like Image Tracking, Location based AR and Marker tracking. This framework is a good way to start getting familiar with AR development if you come from a JavaScript background.
